Visa Related Questions
What is a visa?
U.S. Citizens and lawful permanent residents do not need to obtain a visa to enter the United States. In general, a citizen of a foreign country who seeks to enter the United States must first obtain a U.S. visa. Certain international travelers may be eligible to enter the United States without a visa if they meet the requirements for the U.S. Visa Waiver program. For further information, please visit the Department of State website at https://travel.state.gov.

What types of visas are available?
There are various types of nonimmigrant visas for temporary travel to the United States. The type of visa you need depends on your purpose of travel. For information on all types of visas please visit https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html.

I wish to apply for C1/D and B1/B2 dual visa. What should I do?
You should complete one online DS-160 application form and pay one visa fee in order to schedule an appointment for your C1/D visa.

At the time of your interview, you should inform Consular Officer that you wish to apply for a C1/D and B1/B2 dual visa.

Note: Applying for dual visa is for C1/D, no other nonimmigrant visa combination is acceptable.

Who decides if I will get a visa?
Under U.S. law the Department of State has responsibility for issuing visas, and most visas are issued at one of the Department of State Embassies and Consulates abroad. A U.S. Consular Officer will review your application at the time of the interview and decide whether you are qualified for a visa.

A visa doesn't permit entry to the U.S. A visa simply indicates that your application has been reviewed by a U.S. Consular Officer at US Embassy or Consulate, and that the officer determined you are eligible to travel to the port-of-entry for a specific purpose.

Neither CSRA nor any of our staff play any part or influence in the outcome of your visa application.

How long does it take to process my visa application?
The time it will take for the Consular Section to process your visa application can vary depending on:

the completeness of your visa application
the amount of verification your visa application requires can affect the amount of time it take to process your application
Consular Section may find that you need to provide further information before a decision can be made on your application
If you wish to view the estimate on how long you will have to wait to get an interview appointment, please visit the U.S Department of State online tool at https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/wait-times.html. This online tool will also tell you how long it will take for your visa to be processed at the Consular Section, after a decision is made by a Consular Officer to issue the visa. Please note that the processing time does not include any time required for administrative processing.

What is "administrative processing"?
Some visa applications require further administrative processing, which takes additional time after the visa applicant's interview by a consular officer. Applicants are advised of this requirement at the time of the consular officer interview. After attending the interview, you may track the status of your visa application at https://ceac.state.gov/CEAC or, if applicable, follow any local instructions given to you at the interview. For more information on administrative processing or for case specific inquiries, please visit https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/administrative-processing-information.html or the Consular Section website.

How long am I authorized to stay in the United States?
Applicants should be aware that a visa does not guarantee entry into the United States. Legally, the visa specifies the period during which the bearer may apply at the port-of-entry to enter the United States.

At the port-of-entry, a U.S. immigration officer of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) decides whether to allow you to enter and how long you can stay for any particular visit, as part of the Admission process. Only the U.S. immigration officer has authority to permit you to enter the United States. For further information, please see "Admission to the United States and your Duration of Stay" https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-expiration-date.html.

After I have my visa, will I be able to enter the U.S.?
A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States but allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) immigration officers have the authority to permit or deny entry to the United States. This website (https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors) on U.S. Custom and Border Protection has more information about entry into the United States.

I changed my name. Is my U.S. visa with my old name still valid?
If your name has legally changed through marriage, divorce, or a court ordered name change, you will need to obtain a new passport. Once you have a new passport, the Department of State recommends that you apply for a new U.S. visa to make it easier for you to travel to and from the United States.

Should I book my travel before the interview?
Applicants are strongly advised not to book travel until after they receive their passport and visa.

Visa Renewals and Extensions Questions
How can I extend my visa?
If you want to extend your temporary stay in the United States, you must file a request with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) before your authorized stay expires. If you remain in the United States longer than authorized, you may be barred from returning and/or you may be removed (deported) from the United States. Check the period of stay that was stamped on your passport by Customs and Border protection officials to determine the date your authorized stay expires. To learn more how to extend your visa, please visit USCIS website at https://www.uscis.gov/visit-united-states/extend-your-stay.

I have a nonimmigrant visa that will expire soon. Do I need to go through the whole visa application process again?
Yes, you will need to go through the entire visa application process each time you apply for a visa, even if your visa is still valid. However, those who are renewing a previous U.S. visa or who meet certain other age-related criteria may qualify for a waiver of the visa interview.
